This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
age<- read.csv("age_deaths_covid.csv")
box_age<- ggplot(data=age, aes(x= Age.Group, y=X7.Day.Average, fill=Age.Group))+
scale_y_continuous(n.breaks=20)+
geom_boxplot()+
labs(x= "Age Range", y= "7-day Average Deaths")
box_age
age$Date.of.Death<- as.Date(age$Date.of.Death, format= "%m/%d/%y")
line_age<- ggplot(data= age, aes(x= Date.of.Death, y=X7.Day.Average, group= Age.Group))+
geom_line(aes(color=Age.Group))+
scale_x_date()+
labs(x= "Date of Death", y= "7-Day Death Average")
line_age
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
