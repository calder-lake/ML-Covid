Machine Learning to Model Public Health Data During Covid-19
  Background: Although the exact timing of spikes in Covid-19 cases is hard to predict, certain events seem to inevitably lead to an uptick in Covid-19 infections year to year. An example of this can be seen by observing the rise in new case numbers following the holiday season, particularly following Christmas. Unfortunately, this uptick in cases tends to also lead to an uptick in death totals. 
  Objective: Using publicly available data about Covid-19 case rates in January 2022, a machine learning linear regression model was employed to predict 7-day average Covid-19 fatalities based on the day of the month. The regression model developed for January 2022 will also be mapped onto data from January 2021 to test its predictive value.
