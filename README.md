Machine Learning to Model Public Health Data During Covid-19
  Background: Although the exact timing of spikes in Covid-19 cases is hard to predict, certain events seem to inevitably lead to an uptick in Covid-19 infections year to year. An example of this can be seen by observing the rise in new case numbers following the holiday season, particularly following Christmas. Unfortunately, this uptick in cases tends to also lead to an uptick in death totals. 
  Objective: Using publicly available data about Covid-19 case rates in January 2022, a machine learning linear regression model was employed to predict 7-day average Covid-19 fatalities based on the day of the month. As it is well-documented that people with Covid-19 can be reinfected, it is expected that without intervention a similar pattern of fatalities across the month of January 2023 would occur. However, due to vaccination, fatalities were significantly reduced in January 2023. The regression will be repeated for 2023's data. The difference between the regression will be used to estimate the approximate lives spared by vaccination in the month of January 2023. To further explore interesting aspects of the pandemic, graphs and boxplots will be generated using ggplot in R. Interesting aspects about the unique impact of the pandemic on different demographics will be highlighted.
