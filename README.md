Machine Learning to Model Public Health Data During Covid-19
  Background: Although the exact timing of spikes in Covid-19 cases is hard to predict, certain events seem to inevitably lead to an uptick in Covid-19 infections year to year. An example of this can be seen by observing the rise in new case numbers following the holiday season, particularly following Christmas. Unfortunately, this uptick in cases tends to also lead to an uptick in death totals. It has become clear that certain demographics were uniquely impacted by the pandemic.
  Objective: Using publicly available data about Covid-19 case rates in January 2022, a machine learning linear regression model was employed to predict 7-day average Covid-19 fatalities based on the day of the month. As it is well-documented that people with Covid-19 can be reinfected, it is expected that without intervention a similar pattern of fatalities across the month of January 2023 would occur. However, due to vaccination, fatalities were significantly reduced in January 2023. The regression will be repeated for 2023's data. The difference between the regression will be used to estimate the approximate lives spared by vaccination in the month of January 2023. To further explore interesting aspects of the pandemic, graphs and boxplots will be generated using ggplot in R. Interesting aspects about the unique impact of the pandemic on different demographics will be highlighted. 
  Findings: The data visualization performed in this project supports that the oldest two age groups in Utah suffered many more fatalities during the course of the pandemic, even despite public awareness that the older population was particularly vulnerable (see Covid_deaths_age.nb.html). The lesser number of fatalities in the oldest population group nevertheless represents a much higher proportion of individuals in the age group. In addition, viral sequence data shows that the pandemic in Utah was largely driven by three variant waves (B.1.617.2 starting in Summer 2021, B.1.1.529 starting at the new year in 2022, and BA.5 in Summer 2022) (see Lineage_Number.png, Lineage_Percentage.png, and Week_Number.png). However, many fatalities occurred prior to the availability of sequencing data, at the start of 2021 (see Covid_deaths_age.nb.html and Covid_sequence_data.nb.html). The data support that at around the start of 2022, vaccinations plateaued at around 65% of the population. It is possible that at around this time vaccination and continuing infections led to a degree of herd immunity to protect against future spikes in cases. Indeed, following the peak in cases during the Summer of 2022, no dramatic spikes in cases are reported (see Vaccinated.png, Cases_date.png).
